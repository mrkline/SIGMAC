\chapter{What?}

If you're getting into a modern combat flight sim like BMS or DCS,
there's lots of great guides to learn how to fly:

and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqH078Ef0HENo01LF3xwIvA}{Crash Laobi},
just to name a few.
They'll help you start up, take off, fly around, shoot a few weapons, and land.
But once you're not crashing the jet on a regular basis,
you'll want to learn how to \emph{employ} the jet---how to dogfight,
how to put bombs on a target while dodging missiles,
or how to fly with your friends as a team.

Specific tactics vary from era to era and jet to jet,
but many of the same fundamentals have held for the last 50
years.\punckern\footnote{We'll try to discuss how evolving technology
enables newer tactics as we go.}
This won't be a comprehensive guide,
and contributions are welcome.
But it should outline the basics and point you to resources where you can
learn more.

\section{On Alphabet Soup}

Militaries and pilots both love acronyms,
and the jargon you get when you cross the two is an ungodly mess.
I'll try to introduce relevant acronyms and terms where I can,
but I'm bound to miss a few.
Thankfully, the Internet is full of useful aids---hopefully they can help you
out.\punckern\footnote{%

is a great example.}
